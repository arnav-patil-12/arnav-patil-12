I’m a second-year student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto. My interests lie in computer hardware (FPGAs) and digital electronics for use in machine learning and artificial inteligence.

## Featured Projects

💾 [Memory Initialization File Reformatter](https://github.com/arnav-patil-12/mif-serializer) - ECE241 final project side quest. Serializes address-indexed data values in a MIF.

🌎 [Static Personal Website with Hugo](https://github.com/arnav-patil-12/arnav-patil-12.github.io) - Because courses.skule.ca doesn't have course notes.

🧠 [Deep Learning Framework with NumPy](https://github.com/arnav-patil-12/neural-network-from-scratch) - Vanilla Python neural network to teach myself about AI 🤓

## Course Notes
I maintain a full notes repository on my [personal website](https://arnav-patil-12.github.io/notes), though I upload some weekly lecture notes to GitHub repos.
