## About me

I am an Indsutrial Engineering Student at the University of Toronto, specializing in Operations Research with a minor in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. Right now, I'm learning more about the fundamentals of machine learning, while expanding on my technical skillet. Outside of my classes, I am involved with the Engineering Society (EngSoc) and the IEEE UofT Student Branch (IEEE UofT).
